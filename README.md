## :ballot_box_with_check: About app

BatQiuz 3.0 is... well... the third version of the BatQiuz application.

First version was a small application I made in October 2017 to practice jQuery. It still runs at <a href="http://batquiz.dariusz-mazur.pl/" target="_blank">batquiz.dariusz-mazur.pl</a> (with minor content updates), but.... well, such were my beginnings.

The second BatQuiz was built in vanilla JavaScript. It was created for training purposes and was mainly a playground
for many JS functions. You can check it <a href="https://batquiz.netlify.app/" target="_blank">here</a>

To be honest, BatQuiz was my first ‚Äúreal‚Äù application and was sentimental to me. It was so obvious that one of my first Node apps would support the API for BatQuiz. And creating it was a great opportunity to build BatQuiz again. This time using React.
